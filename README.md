# Weather Dashboard
This project focuses on using the Open Weather One-Call API to create a weather dashboard allowing users to search for their city (or any city) and see the current weather as well as a 5-day forecast for that city.

I used <code>localStorage</code> to add searched cities to the history. This ensures an intuitive, efficient user experience for quickly returning to previous searches.

The difficult thing for this project was, of course, to successfully request and use data from the Open Weather One Call API. It wasn't as difficult as I expected, but it was a wonderful learning experience. The first step was to get the coordinates based on a city name, and then use those coordinates to retrieve the weather data. I became more comfortable with error handling, and even made use of that to bring up a tooltip to let users know their search wasn't successful (no cities found).
